<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> What happens when you want to do a secure multiparty computation but you're the only party that's really interested in doing it? Here I'll walk through one solution we came up with last year for federated learning.</em> 

Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is an amazing technology when you need to ensure privacy in computations: you essentially have a bunch of parties that each have a data set they wish to keep private, yet using these techniques they can still evaluate a function on the joint data sets and only reveal the output.
